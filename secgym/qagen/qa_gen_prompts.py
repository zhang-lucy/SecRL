#TODO: Add incident info, how much to use?
TWEAKED_QAGEN_PROMPT_ORIGIN = """

Your goal is to ask a security question to test a junior security analyst's ability to understand a security incident and their reasoning capabilities.
You will be given a security incident composed of a group of related alerts connected by data elements or entities that are shared between the alerts such as User accounts, Hosts, Mailboxes, IP addresses, Files, Cloud applications, Processes, URLs etc. Alerts are signals that result from various threat detection activities. These signals indicate the occurrence of malicious or suspicious events in your environment.

Specifically to generate a question, you will be given an alert-entity path from the given security incident. This will include a start alert and end alert, and corresponding entities involved in the start and end alert. The two alerts are connected by a alert-entity path. Some of the entities on the alert-entity path are ommitted (replaced by ???) in order to test the junior analyst's ability to find these connections on their own. The start and end alert might be the same.
You will use the start alert along with the overall incident details as the context, and ask a question about the entities part of the end alert.

The JSON must have the following fields:
- "question": the question about the end alert. The question should be carefully crafted so that:
    1. The question should be natural and relevant to the context, and it should be clear and have a deterministic answer.
    2. But it should not leak the answer. If the start and end alert are the same, you should be more careful since the given entities may have overlapping information.
    3. The question should be specific of the answer you are looking for, and the answer should match the question.
- "answer": the answer to the question. You may be given one or more entities from the end alert, select the most meaningful entity and make sure it is not leaked in the context or question.
- "context": the context from the start alert and overall incident. You should combine the alert and the entities given in a consistent sentence. You can simplify the context a bit if it is too long. Make sure the answer is not leaked in the context. If the start alert or the related entities contains the answer, you should remove it from the context.

QAGEN_PROMPT_WITH_ENTRY = """Your goal is to ask a security question from the given data from a security analyst's perspective.
You are given an alert-entity graph. The graph starts and ends in entity nodes. Intermediate alert and entities are also given. 

How to use the information provided:
1. The question should be about the end entity (it should be the answer to the question). So NEVER include the end entity in the context or question.
2. Always include start entities (if not all) in the context/question. Use the alert information to connect the context and question.
3. Try not to include the exact values of connecting entities, or intermediate entites.
4. At repetitive entities: If the entity is also an end entity, you MUST NOT include it in the context/question. If the entity is a start entity, you can include it in the context/question.

Note:
- If there is one alert, that means the start and end alerts are the same.

The JSON must have the following fields:
- "context": the context from the start alert. you should combine the alert and the (start) entities given in a consistent sentence. You can simplify the context a bit if it is too long. Make sure the answer is not leaked in the context. If the start alert or the related entities contains the answer, you should remove it from the context.
    - Try to connect the context and the question in a natural way using the intermediate alerts.
- "question": the question about the end alert. The question should be carefully crafted so that:
    1. The question should be natural and relevant to the context, and it should be clear and have a deterministic answer.
    2. But it should not leak the answer. If the start and end alert are the same, you should be more careful since the given entities may have overlapping information.
    3. The question should be specific of the answer you are looking for, and the answer should match the question.
- "answer": the answer to the question. You may be given one or more entities from the end alert, select the most meaningful entity and make sure it is not leaked in the context or question.
